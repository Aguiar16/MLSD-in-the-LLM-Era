Replication Package for the paper "Multi-language Software Development in the LLM Era:
Insights from Practitionersâ€™ Conversations with ChatGPT"

This research was done with 2023-10-12 release of DevGPT that can be found on https://github.com/NAIST-SE/DevGPT/tree/main/snapshot_20231012.

After downloading the snapshot, extract the archives into the same folder of the notebooks.

For replication, on the 'analysis_single_source.ipynb' script, we got all metrics for every file individually, there, the variable "fileNumber" is used to select each of the JSON who will be used individually.

For overall metrics, the 'analysis_all_sources.ipynb' file was used.

Normalisation process is inside of both files and can be found below 'Normalisation' markdown.
